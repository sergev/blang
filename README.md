The goal of the project is to build a compiler for the B programming language.
The compiler should be written in Go, and emit assembly code for X86_64 architecture.

The B programming language was developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1969 and was later replaced by C.

Directory c-prototype/ contains sources of a similar compiler, but written in C.
It should be rewritten into Go, retaining existing functionality.
See c-prototype/README.md for details.
