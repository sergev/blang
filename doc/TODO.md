# B Language Compiler - TODO List

## 🚧 Pending Language Features

### High Priority

#### 1. Compound Assignment Operators
**Status:** Not implemented (15 tests skipped)
**Test Coverage:** `TestCompoundAssignments` in `compiler_test.go`

Implement all compound assignment operators from the B language specification:
- Arithmetic: `=+`, `=-`, `=*`, `=/`, `=%`
- Bitwise shifts: `=<<`, `=>>`
- Comparison: `=<`, `=<=`, `=>`, `=>=`, `=!=`, `===`
- Bitwise: `=&`, `=|`

**Workaround:** Use expanded form (e.g., `x = x + 5` instead of `x =+ 5`)

**Implementation Notes:**
- These operators are syntactically distinct from prefix operators
- `x =+ 5` means `x = x + 5`, not `x = (+5)`
- Parser needs to handle the `=` followed by operator without whitespace
- See `oldtests/assignment_test.cpp` for expected behavior

**Files to modify:**
- `lexer.go` - May need token lookahead for `=+` vs `= +`
- `expr.go` - Add compound assignment parsing in `parseExpressionLLVMWithLevel`
- `compiler_test.go` - Remove `t.Skip()` from `TestCompoundAssignments`

---

#### 2. Ternary Conditional Operator (`? :`)
**Status:** Not implemented (1 test skipped)
**Test Coverage:** `TestFunctions/function_ternary_operator`

Implement the ternary conditional operator:
```b
result = condition ? true_value : false_value;
```

**Example:**
```b
choose(a, b, c) {
    return (a ? b : c);
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Precedence: Between assignment and logical OR
- Right-associative
- Returns type should be the common type of both branches
- In LLVM IR, use `select` instruction or conditional branches

**Files to modify:**
- `expr.go` - Add ternary operator parsing at appropriate precedence level
- `compiler_test.go` - Remove `t.Skip()` from ternary operator test

---

### Medium Priority

#### 3. Indirect Function Calls via `extrn` Function Pointers
**Status:** Partially implemented
**Current Behavior:** `extrn` variables are created, but calling through them is not supported

**Example:**
```b
extrn printf;  /* printf is a function pointer variable */

main() {
    printf("hello");  /* Should do indirect call through pointer */
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- When `extrn name` is declared, `name` becomes a variable holding a function pointer
- Direct function calls: `name(...)` where `name` is defined as a function
- Indirect calls: `name(...)` where `name` is an `extrn` variable

**Current Implementation:**
- `GetOrDeclareFunction` returns `nil` for `extrn` names
- Caller needs to handle indirect call through function pointer
- See `codegen.go:145-164` for current logic

**Files to modify:**
- `expr.go` - Update postfix function call handler to support indirect calls
- Add test case for indirect function calls

## 🎯 Next Steps

**Recommended Priority Order:**

1. **Implement Ternary Operator** (1-2 hours)
   - Small, self-contained feature
   - Completes function tests
   - Good warm-up for compound assignments

2. **Implement Compound Assignments** (4-6 hours)
   - More complex due to operator variety
   - High test coverage (15 tests)
   - Significant language feature

3. **Indirect Function Calls** (2-3 hours)
   - Edge case but important for flexibility
   - May require refactoring of call handling

4. **Code Quality Improvements** (ongoing)
   - Better error messages
   - More documentation
   - Performance optimization
