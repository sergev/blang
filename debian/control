Description: B programming language compiler
 A modern B programming language compiler written in Go with LLVM IR backend
 and clang-like command-line interface.
 .
 The B programming language was developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
 at Bell Labs in 1969 as the predecessor to C.
 .
 Features:
  * Complete B Language Support: All B language features implemented
  * Cross-platform: Runs natively on Linux (x86_64, ARM64, RISC-V) and macOS
  * Clang-like CLI Interface: Professional command-line options and workflow
  * Multiple Output Formats: Executable, object files, assembly, LLVM IR
  * LLVM IR Backend: Portable, optimized code generation
  * Comprehensive Testing: 225 tests across 8 organized test files
  * Modern Go Implementation: Clean, maintainable codebase
 .
 The compiler includes the B runtime library (libb.a) and example programs.
